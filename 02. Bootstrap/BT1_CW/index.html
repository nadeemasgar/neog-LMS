          The Taj Mahal is a stunning white marble mausoleum in Agra, India,
          built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It is
          widely regarded as one of the world's most beautiful buildings and is
          celebrated for its architectural brilliance, intricate craftsmanship,
          and symbolic significance.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-light">
          Shah Jahan commissioned the Taj Mahal in memory of his beloved wife,
          Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. Construction began
          in 1632 and was largely completed by 1643, although additional
          elements continued for a few more years.
